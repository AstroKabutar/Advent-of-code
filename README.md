This is my collection of advent of code challenges   
Every folder has a "file.hpp" and "file_imple.cpp" which has required codes and implementations as per needed  
Use c++ standered 20 to compile  
g++ file_imple.cpp <challangefile.cpp> -std=c++20  
There is no need to use valgrind or address sanitizer since i already checked it as i am practicing a good code practice :D
